# Problem 1:

While my choices may be wrong, i chose each based on the following reason:

a) Since the action of asking questions resulted them to be in a specific state of little doubt, I thoght it would be #3

b) Similarly, the departure (an action) resulted to be in a specific state. Hence I thought it would be #3

c) Here the person wants to exit and since he/she specified "here" - the actual place of departure, I thought it would be #5.

d) In contrast to above example, the leaving or departing did not involve specifying a location. It was just leaving in general, so I thought it was #1. (Based this off the examples wordnet online had)

e) The result of sweeping the house was that the man was left with no means. Since something resulted or lead to this, I thought it was #7

f) Since after the activity, there has to be amount remaining, I went with #11

g) Since there was no trace (no remainder) I went #11

h) Similarly, since he has no one left (or no one remaining), I went with #11. #12 didnt seem appropriate because he did not leave someone behind.

i) Here, those several sequence of actions or events made Piepsam define himself in a specific state. Hence I went with #3

j) Similary for a reason above. The audience is leaving the departing location was specified, so I went #5. (only way to distinguish between this and #1)

Hardest to distinguish were:
c, d and j.

While it is obvious that they mean depart (I assume).
The word sense #1 and #5 seem like synonyms and makes it
almost impossible to decipher.

The groups hardest to decipher between where:

#1 and #5

I marked something as #1 if the place that was being left was 
not explicitly defined

I marked something as #5 if the place was explicitly defined.

#3, #7, #11 was hard as well.

I marked something as #3 if a verb (or action) caused something
to be in a specific state.

I marked something as #7 if a noun caused something to end
in a certain way

I marked something as #11, using the remainder hint.

# Problem 2:

a)
Total think cases: 12

Total cases = 27

P(THINK) = 12/27 = 0.444

b) 

Total experience cases = 15
Let I be a feature, it appears 9 times in setences that are labelled as experience

P(I | Experience) = 9/15 = 0.6

c)

For experience

P(EXP) * P(I|EXP) * P(that|EXP) * P(there|EXP) * P(was|EXP) * P(a|EXP) * P(pain|EXP) * P(in|EXP) * P(my|EXP) * P(leg|EXP)

= 
0.555  * 0.6      * 0.066       * 0.066        * 0.066      * 0.33     * 0.2667      * 0.066     * 0.2667    * 0.066
= 0.000000009788674

For thinking

=
P(THINK) * 
P(I|THINK) * P(that|THINK) * P(there|THINK) * P(was|THINK) * P(a|THINK) * P(pain|THINK) * P(in|THINK) * P(my|THINK) * P(leg|THINK)

=
0.444 * 0.25 * 0.583 * 0.0833 * 0.1667 * 0.0833 * 0.0833 * 0.0833 * 0.0833 * 0.0833

= 0.000000003604103

There is a higher chance that the word is under EXPERIENCE
